You don't have to have heard of Newton to observe that things fall to the ground when unsupported, or that rainbows are visible in the sky after rain. You don't have to have heard of Mendel or Darwin to observe that breeding large bulls with large cows tends to produce calves that also grow up to be large. You don't have to *believe* in quantum mechanics - you can just start using the nearest computer or mobile phone and observe that devices based on those principles *work* in the real world. The fact that satellite communications works is direct evidence that relativistic physics, Maxwell's equations and many other scientific principles are all accurate descriptions of the real world (at least in the vicinity of Earth).<br><br><br>So we don't have to take the existence of the physical world and the claims of science on trust the way we do any claims regarding transcendental worlds that are out of reach of our tools of perception. We can poke it and prod it and generally experience it for ourselves.<br><br><br>Atheism stops at that point and says "We're still exploring and learning and expanding the scope of our perceptions. This Universe definitely exists, Descartes notwithstanding, and we all share the same one with each other, so we should probably figure out how to get along with each other and not blow up or otherwise trash the particular rock we happen to currently live on. If there are transcendental forces interfering in our lives, then they're doing a very good job of avoiding leaving any solid evidence of their presence. Beyond that, we'll just have to live with doubt for a while longer." <br><br><br>Religions (and other belief systems) insist on providing speculative details of transcendental entities or forces that may or may not exist, and claiming that these assertions are accurate. Some of them might even turn out to be right in the long run, but given our current tools of perception, there's no basis for choosing between the ones that are careful to avoid making claims that flatly contradict our observations of the real world (and even after you eliminate the ones that don't gibe with reality as we experience it, there are still a multitude of them left to choose from).<br><br><br>In practice, rediscovering humanity's best collective understanding of how the universe works for ourselves would take far too long, so most of us learn the details by reading or hearing about them, which can make science and atheism look more like a faith-based religion. However, it's important to remember that the underlying empirical basis and insistence that beliefs and predictions align with the way the universe actually works makes a big difference in how the associated world view evolves with time. In particular, "beliefs are subject to empirical verification".</p></body></html>
