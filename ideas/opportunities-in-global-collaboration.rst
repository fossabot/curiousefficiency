During the two years I spent on the Python Software Foundation's Board of
Directors, one of the more interesting projects I had the opportunity to assist
was the
["Argentina en Python"](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/03/manuel-kaufmann-and-python-in-argentina.html)
project started by Manuel Kaufmann to introduce different communities throughout
Argentina and South America to the potential of Python and open source
software as problem solving tools, and to create self-sustaining interest
groups in the communities they visited.
